### Note

Project came from an idea by a group of three members (Jared Huang, Sana Shrikant, and Akaash Venkat) working on Northrop Grummanâ€™s 2018 Intern Hackathon in August, at the Woodland Hills campus. 
Code written by Akaash Venkat, who extended the project to work on it independent of the hackathon (ongoing).
